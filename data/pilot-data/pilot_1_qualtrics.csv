","If there was any lines that crossed the boundaries of the profit going into the negative values I did not select it. Additionally, if the line itself was mostly in the positive with the dot above the value one and had a small line which represented the variance in the numbers, I also chose this region as I believed it would overall produce a profit.

This worked out pretty well for me but on the rate occasion it back fired. On the last trial, since there was such a huge penalty for picking a region and it turning out to be unprofitable, I was a LOT more careful.
